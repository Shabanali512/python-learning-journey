# 🔹 LISTS

A list is a collection of multiple values in one variable.

Example:
numbers = [10, 20, 30]

Lists are:
- Ordered
- Mutable (changeable)
- Allow duplicates

---

# 🔹 TUPLES

A tuple is similar to list but cannot be changed.

Example:
data = (10, 20, 30)

Tuples are:
- Ordered
- Immutable (not changeable)
- Allow duplicates

---

# 🔥 Difference

List → []
Tuple → ()

List is mutable  
Tuple is immutable
